      "title": "What are Sorting Algorithms?",
      "description": "<paragraph>Sorting algorithms are methods for reorganizing a sequence of items in a specific order, typically in ascending or descending sequence. These algorithms are fundamental to computer science and form the backbone of many complex systems.</paragraph><paragraph>From organizing databases to optimizing search functions, sorting algorithms play a crucial role in software development. Understanding how they work and their efficiency characteristics helps developers choose the right algorithm for specific tasks.</paragraph>",
